# Bank Git

Bank Git is an application built with Flutter and Firebase to help you manage your bank account in a more efficient way.

Bank Git breaks your bank account into multiple branches, which you will define according to your preferencess and the total money in your account will be managed under `master` branch.

It is just like `git`, just modified to work efficiently for your bank account.

Operations suppported on a branch :

1. Transfer money from one branch to another branch.
2. Make payments from a specific branch(Changes will reflect only in current branch and `master` branch).
3. All the transactions will be shown in current branch details with transaction money and money in that branch during that specific transaction.

You can also make payments from the application via UPI. Supported UPI apps are (Android and iOS) : 

1. BHIM UPI
2. PayTm
3. Google Pay
4. Amazon Pay
